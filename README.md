/* This is an informal github repo for any knowledge I learn when it comes to data structures.
* I will cover arrays, linked lists, stack, queue, heap, binary search trees, hash tables, and graphs.
* I will also have dedicated to basic algorithms like Binary search, Bubble sort, Merge sort, Insertion sort,
* and Quick sort.
* I am just a college kid learning as much as I can.
